# Fusion Airaware – LoRa-based Decentralized Atmospheric Gas Monitoring Network

## Problem Statement
Air pollution and harmful gas emissions are major concerns for public health and the environment.  
Traditional air quality monitoring systems are often expensive, centralized, and limited in coverage,  
making them unsuitable for scalable deployment in urban and rural areas.  

**Fusion airaware** solves this by creating a **low-cost, solar-powered, decentralized network** of air quality monitoring nodes.  
Using LoRa for long-range communication and blockchain-style data storage for security,  
Fusion airaware ensures real-time, tamper-proof environmental data sharing across all nodes in the network.
